# Smart Fabunmi
I'm a Software Engineer building my version of the digital world, one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code.   I focus on bringing great ideas to life and building robust and scalable enterprise applications.
